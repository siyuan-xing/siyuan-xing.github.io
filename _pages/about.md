I am an assitant professor in the [Mechanical Engineering Department](https://me.calpoly.edu) at [California Polytechnic State University](https://www.calpoly.edu).

My research mainly focuses on nonlinear dynamics with applications in mechanical vibrations, control systems, and robotics. I am particularly interested in developing computational tools to uncover governing equations, predict complex patterns, and analyze bifurcations in nonlinear systems. Currently, my work explores interpretable neural networks to accelerate scientific discovery and enhance our understanding of complex phenomena.
